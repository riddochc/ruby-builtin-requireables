== Description

Lists strings that may be required safely with a plain ruby installation

This produces a list of strings such as "set" and "base64" that should always succeed with require... unless there's a broken ruby installation.

== Requirements

* Ruby

== Installation

gem install ruby-builtin-requireables

== Use

This program provides a script you can run, like so:

   $ ruby-builtin-requireables
   English
   abbrev
   base64
   benchmark
   ...

This is meant for use in things like git commit hooks or Rakefiles for providing dependency management hints.

An snippet from Rakefiles I use this in:

  builtin_requireables = IO.popen("ruby-builtin-requireables").readlines.map(&:chomp)
  
  # ... define all_requires to be a list of all the strings given to `require` keywords
  # ... make hashes of gem name = version, for dependencies and dev_dependencies

  missing_deps = (all_requires - builtin_requireables - dependencies.keys - dev_dependencies.keys)
  if missing_deps.length > 0
    puts "There may be some dependencies not listed in project.yml:"
    puts missing_deps.join(", ")
  end
